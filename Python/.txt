def fibo(n)
n=("Enter the value of the fibo")

  if n==1:
        return 0
    elif n==2:
        return 1
    elif n==0:
        return "invalid Input"
    else:
        return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)

The formulae to find the fibonacci series is as the following


fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)

if the num is given 8 or 9 or 10 or as so on as to the given condition the term keeps calculating as the given condition....


#like if the number or the terms is 8 or so on then the stuff goes on
if n==8 
fibo(8-1) + fibo (8-2)= 7+6 = 13
fibo(7-1) + fibo (7-2)=6+5
fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)=
fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)=
fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)=
fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)=
fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)=
fibo(n-1) + fibo (n-2)=
